# TFL Journey Planner 

This Solution automates the testing of the "Plan a journey" widget (Journey Planner) on the 
Transport for London (https://tfl.gov.uk/plan-a-journey) website using ReqNRoll, Playwright and  C#. 
The widget is accessible from the TfL homepage or by selecting the "Plan a journey" tab, 
and it allows users to input journey details and preferences to get optimized route suggestions.

# Project Overview

This solution is focused on automating and validating the functionality of the **Journey Planner** widget. While TfLâ€™s website includes a range of services and features, this project covers the Plan My Journey, which allows users to:

1. **Input an origin and destination** for a journey.
2. **Edit preferences** (e.g., routes with the least walking).
3. **View journey suggestions** with an estimated time based on the specified criteria.
4. **Validate the Journey results** with invalid Journey Planned.
5. **Validate the Journey** with no locations

By using this solution, we aim to ensure that the Journey Planner widget meets expected user functionality and provides accurate, preference-based results.

# Features
